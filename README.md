# LinearRegression-GradientDescent

This repository has 2 projects:
1. Linear regression with randomly generated data that has 2 features. the data is graphed with the regression on a 2d plane 
2. Linear regression to guess housing prices in California(10 features)

For the linear regression on randomly generated data, I was able to use simple algebra to create the model.

I used linear algebra with the same algorithm in numpy for the housing prices because the data was in R11.
